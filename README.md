 Using sql to analysis examines e-commerce performance across three key months
##Overview
This analysis examines e-commerce performance across three key months (January to March 2017). The metrics include:

Product Views (num_product_view): Total number of product views.
Add to Cart (num_add_to_cart): Total number of products added to cart.
Purchases (num_purchase): Total number of purchases.
Add-to-Cart Rate (add_to_cart_rate): Percentage of product views that resulted in adding to cart.
Purchase Rate (purchase_rate): Percentage of product views that resulted in purchases.
##Key Insights
Steady Growth in Performance Metrics:

Product views decreased slightly in February but rebounded in March.
Both the number of add-to-cart actions and purchases show consistent growth month over month.
Purchases increased from 2,143 (January) to 2,977 (March), indicating growing consumer engagement.
Improvement in Conversion Rates:

The add-to-cart rate improved from 28.47% (January) to 37.29% (March).
The purchase rate rose significantly from 8.31% (January) to 12.64% (March), signaling better product appeal or marketing strategies.
February Drop in Product Views:

A notable decrease in product views in February (21,489) may suggest reduced traffic, potentially due to seasonality or marketing shifts. However, conversion rates compensated for this decline, with higher add-to-cart and purchase rates.
##Recommendations
Focus on Traffic Growth: While conversion rates improved, the drop in February product views highlights a need for strategies to sustain and grow traffic, such as targeted marketing campaigns.
Leverage Conversion Success: Marchâ€™s increased purchase rate indicates effective changes. These strategies should be identified and replicated in future campaigns.
Monitor Seasonal Trends: Investigate February's decline to understand potential seasonal impacts and prepare for similar patterns.
##Conclusion
The upward trend in key metrics and conversion rates reflects strong performance. Addressing traffic issues and maintaining the conversion momentum will further drive business growth.
